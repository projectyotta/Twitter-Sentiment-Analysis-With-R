# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Donald-Trump
Gathered tweets referencing Donald Trump; performed a basic sentiment analysis on them and then mapped their locations 

Process : 

> Collect tweets, having a chosen keyword, save them onto a database and clean them up to have only necessary information.
  ( Used the twitteR package , Twitter Streaming API, R ) 
  
> Classify the tweets based on Sentiment with a score of +100(extremely positive) to -100(Extremely negative)
 ( used R ) 

> Represent the locations and frequencies of the tweets geographically. 



Analysis :

> Keep in mind this was done when Donald Trump was just getting started with his campaign. 

> The "power hubs" in the United States , ie , major cities along the East coast ( NYC , DC etc ) and West coast ( San Francisco , LA etc ) were the places with the maximum number of tweets. 

> The center of the country did not have a lot to say about the Trumpster, be it positive or negative. 

> The West coast had a relatively negative opinion of the Trumpster, while the East coast (especially the region around NYC) had a  positive opinion. 

> People tend to tweet after work hours. 

> The sentiment tends to fluctuate wildly (along with the number of tweets) whenever his name is mentioned in public. For instance, when J.K. Rowling compared him to Voldemort ( https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/674196610683940864?lang=en ) , Twitter exploded with his mentions. 

> Sentiment has no relation to the time of the day , with a host of positive and negative sentiments being expressed throughout the 24 hour window.
